## What is CCTP Frame?

CCTP Frame is a cross-chain tooling that allows users to transfer USDC across different blockchain networks using Wormhole and Farcaster Frames.

## Which blockchains are supported?

CCTP Frame currently supports the following blockchains:

- Base
- Optimism
- Arbitrum
- Avalanche

## How do I use CCTP Frame?

You can use CCTP Frame either through the website UI or by casting a frame on Warpcast. Refer to the "How to Use CCTP Frame" page for detailed instructions.

## What happens if I enter the wrong recipient address?

Please be cautious while entering recipient addresses, as transactions cannot be reversed once confirmed on the blockchain. Double-check the address before confirming the transaction.

## How long does the bridging process take?

The bridging process typically takes a few minutes, depending on the network congestion and confirmation times of the source and target blockchains. You can track your transaction status on [Wormhole Scan](https://wormholescan.io/).

## Can I bridge other assets besides USDC?

Currently, CCTP Frame only supports the bridging of USDC tokens. Support for additional assets may be added in the future.
